# AutomatedPdfConverter
INFO3888 Project Application

## Description
As part of the INFO3888 project, my group and I wanted to create a way to automate the retrieval of PDF files from www.medicineaustralia.com.au and merge them into one complete file for a specific year. Inside of this repository, there is a virtual environment with all of the required dependencies and also the final executable file.

## Using this Repo
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. To activate the virtual environment, run the activate.bat file located in ./env/Scripts/
3. To run the python code without UI, run functions.py
4. To run the UI, run gui.py

## Using the executable
1. From the repository, under ./dist/, there is a gui.exe file that can be launched to start the application
2. There are four fields that need to be filled:
   - Enter Homepage URL
     - This is the field for the homepage of the website
     - E.g. [https:](https://www.medicinesaustralia.com.au)
   - Enter Extension of URL
     - This field is for the exact URL for the location of PDF files
     - E.g. /code-of-conduct/transparency-reporting/health-consumer-organisation-support-reports/member-company-reports/
   - File Directory
     - Select desired file directory for .pdf files and .csv file
   - Enter Year
     - Enter the year of the data that would be both the filename and year column in final .csv file
3. Press the start button
4. Terminal Output
   - The output of the program will be written into the text box below the submit button
   - This would list the files that the program was unable to find the correct formatting to convert the pdf files into a csv format
   - It is recommended that these files are manually added into the excel file using other methods
5. .csv Output
   - There may be values with a placeholder value: Nothing... Please Check Values
   - For these values, please check actual pdf files for the values
     - Most cases are just extra rows created

## Testing
There are currently no exact test cases but all of the data generated by the project outcome was done using the python script. If requested, there can be test cases made for this application.
